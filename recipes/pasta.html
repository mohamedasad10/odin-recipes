    <h1>Creamy Pasta</h1>
    <p>It's your creamy pasta dream come true...loaded with golden buttery garlicky 
        mushrooms! SCALING UP (slide scaler): Cook mushroom in batches, otherwise 
        they'll steam instead of going golden.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>160g/ 6oz fettuccine or linguine</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>300g/ 10 oz mushrooms , sliced 1/3 cm / 1/8" thick (white, cremini/swiss brown)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves , finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) white wine , dry (or rose, sub more broth)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125ml) chicken broth/stock , low sodium (or veg)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (185ml) cream , heavy / thickened </li>
        <li>1/3 cup (30g) parmesan , finely grated</li> 
        <li>1/2 tsp salt and pepper , each</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute less than time per packet (start this mid mushroom cook). Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup cooking water, then drain.</li>
        <li> butter and heat oil in a large skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and cook, stirring regularly. When they start to sweat, add a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When pretty golden (about 4 - 5 minutes), add garlic and cook until garlic is golden and mushroom is golden.</li>
        <li>Stand back and add wine (it will be steamy!!), stir, scraping the bottom of the skillet. Simmer rapidly until wine is mostly evaporated and winey smell is gone.</li>
        <li>Add broth, cream, parmesan, salt and pepper. Stir to dissolve parmesan and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
        <li>Transfer pasta into sauce, toss for 1 - 2 minutes until sauce thickens and coats pasta. If sauce gets too thick (rather than slick, see video), add a splash of reserved pasta cooking water.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with extra parmesan!</li>
    </ol>
