    <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>

    <p>Crispy seasoned chicken breast, topped with a mandatory slice of melted cheese 
        and piled onto soft rolls with onion, avocado, lettuce, tomato and garlic mayo. 
        The key to juicy chicken is to cook it hard and fast! You can eyeball the Seasoning
        it will be tasty as long as you use "around" the right amounts.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Seasoning:</h3>
        <li>1/3 cup /80g flour (any white)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>¾ tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp thyme</li>
        <li>½ tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp onion powder</li>

        <h3>Burgers:</h3>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large onions , halved them sliced (white, brown or yellow)</li>
        <li>400 – 500g / 14 oz – 1 lb chicken breast (2 pieces) , cut in half horizontally into 2 thin steaks</li>
        <li>4 – 8 slices Swiss or other melting cheese slices (Note 1)</li>
        <li>4 soft rolls (I used brioche burger buns)</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes</li>

        <h3>Garlic Mayo:</h3>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise (I use whole egg)</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove , minced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix Garlic Mayo ingredients in a small bowl, set aside for 20+ minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix Seasoning in a flat bowl / dish.</li>
        <li>If required, pound chicken to about 1 cm / 2/5” thick. If wanting to be exact, trim to shape of rolls BUT ensure it is about 15% larger (it shrinks)</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat (if doing on BBQ, drizzle flat plate).</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook, turning regularly, for 5 minutes until golden. Season with salt and pepper, toss, then remove.</li>
        <li>While cooking the onions, preheat oven to 160C/320F. Split rolls, then lightly toast / warm the rolls (if using BBQ, just toast the cut side until crispy). Leave in turned off oven with door ajar while you cook chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil into the same skillet, still on high heat.</li>
        <li>Dredge chicken in Seasoning, shake off excess, then place in skillet. Repeat.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2 ½ minutes until golden, then flip.</li>
        <li>Top with cheese then leave for 1 1/2 minutes. When the underside is golden, if the cheese is not yet melted, place lid on for 15 seconds (or tray or foil).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from skillet onto plate. Cover loosely with foil while you start assembling the burgers.</li>

        <h3>Burgers:</h3>
        <li>Smear base of roll with avocado, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with chicken, onion, lettuce then tomato.</li>
        <li>Smear lid of roll with Garlic Mayo, place on burger. Enjoy!</li>
