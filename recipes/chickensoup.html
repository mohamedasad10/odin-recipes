    <h1>Chciken Soup</h1>
    <p>Creamy broth, juicy little bits of chicken, pasta (I used small shells), swirls 
        of spinach and a sprinkling of sun dried tomato which I use instead of the usual 
        croutons. Easy, one pot, quick to make, and great for making ahead.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g/1 lb chicken thighs , skinless boneless</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
        <li>30g / 2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 onion , finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>2 large celery stems , finely sliced (sub 2 carrots)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chardonnay or other dry white wine, optional</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock/broth , low sodium
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>250g/8 oz small pasta shells (or other small pasta, rice, potato etc)</li>
        <li>1 cup (tightly packed) parmesan, finely grated or store bought pre-grated (sandy type)</li> 
        <li>1 cup thickened/heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 packed cups baby spinach , chopped kale or similar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun dried tomato strips , chopped into 1cm pieces, plus bit of oil drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook outside of chicken – Sprinkle each side with the salt and pepper. Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Once foamy, place the chicken in and cook the first side for 3 minutes or until light golden, then the other side for 2 minutes – it's fine if the inside is still raw, it cooks more later. Remove onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Soup flavour base – Turn the stove down to medium low. Add garlic, onion and celery into the same pot then cook for 3 minutes or until the onion is softened.</li>
        <li>Deglaze – Turn up to high, add wine, stir, then let it simmer until the wine reduces by half.</li>
        <li>Broth & pasta – Add stock/broth, water, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then add the pasta. Cook for the time per the pasta packet directions (~10 minutes), stirring every now and then so the pasta doesn't stick to the base of the pot.</li>
        <li>Add chicken partway – While the pasta is cooking, chop the chicken into 1.5cm / 1/2" pieces then add into the pot to finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Finish soup – Once the pasta is cooked, turn heat down to low. Stir in parmesan until melted. Stir in the cornflour-water mixture, cream and spinach. Stir for a minute until spinach is wilted and soup thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Serve – Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with sun dried tomato strips (and a bit of oil looks nice for finishing).</li>
        <li>Storing – Separate pasta from soup so it doesn't bloat, refrigerate both. Just scoop out with slotted spoon.</li>
    </ol>
